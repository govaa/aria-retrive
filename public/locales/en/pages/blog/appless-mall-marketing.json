    "text-1":"Stop building apps for your Shopping Mall Nobody will download them.",
    "text-2":"Here is what you need to do.",
    "text-3":"Running a mall is not an easy task. You need to make sure your tenants are happy, your customers are satisfied, and your profits are maximized. To achieve these goals, you need to gather as much data as possible to make informed decisions. This is where Ariadne comes in. In this blog post, we will elaborate on the benefits of Ariadne and how it can help you achieve your goals.",
    "text-4":"At Ariadne, we have observed a common pattern among many shopping center clients. The pattern goes as follows, they first invest a small budget in developing an application to communicate with the mall visitors, only to discover that very few people download it. To address this, they end up spending significantly more money on app promotion, with mixed results. In some cases, they are able to boost downloads, but unfortunately, many of these downloads are not coming from individuals who visit the shopping center. ",
    "text-5":"However, it is not uncommon for app downloads to originate from locations outside of the city or even country where the shopping center is located. This can result in a significant waste of resources for the shopping center.",
    "text-6":"At Ariadne, we have the ability to track the number of customers who have installed the shopping center's application, and what we've found is a recurring ratio: ",
    "text-7":"one person in one thousand visitors is using the application. ",
    "text-8":"So, one in thousand visitors are installing the application of the shopping center. This might seem counterintuitive, especially if you have personally witnessed tens or even hundreds of thousands of downloads. After all, the number of visitors to the shopping center is unlikely to exceed twenty-five thousand. So how can this ratio be accurate?",    
    "text-9":"The answer becomes apparent when visualizing the situation using a Venn diagram. If we consider the group on the left to be users who have downloaded the app, and the group on the right to be customers who have visited the shopping center, then the focus should be on the overlapping region of the two groups. By honing in on this intersection, we can gain a more accurate understanding of how many visitors are also app users, and use this information to inform marketing and promotional efforts. To make things even worst, if you wish to obtain spatial analytics, for example to answer questions such as to find the sequence of stores people love to visit together you need to have your visitors using the application while they are located in the shopping center.",
    "text-10":"Easy Opt-In Process",
    "text-11":"We know that engaging with visitors in a shopping center can be a challenge, especially when they are looking for a hassle-free experience. That's where Ariadne comes in! Our marketing service offers a seamless opt-in process that doesn't require any app installation. Visitors can simply opt-in via our free WiFi network, by scanning a QR code, or by tapping an NFC. ",
    "text-12":"With our innovative approach, we've recorded 200 times more opt-ins than traditional application downloads!",
    "text-13":"What's more, our opt-in rates are consistently high, with ",
    "text-14":"up to 60% of visitors choosing to opt-in daily. ",
    "text-15":"This means that you can target these visitors directly and easily based on their location within the shopping center. With Ariadne, you can reach out to them at any time, using customized campaigns tailored to their needs. For example, you can push campaign A to all users that have visited store Y.

Join Ariadne today and experience the power of hassle-free marketing!",
    "text-16":"Plug-n-Play Solution",
    "text-17":"We know that installation of new technology can be a daunting task, but with Ariadne, you can rest assured that it's a breeze. Our service does not require any cameras, which means you don't have to worry about intensive installation or additional cabling that camera solutions often demand. Instead, we use signals emitted by phones, which are uniformly distributed in space and can even penetrate walls. This means that Ariadne surveyors can be easily installed in your building without requiring line-of-sight to your visitors or overlap with each other.",
    "text-18":"Our surveyors only use 5 Volt and 3 mAh, which makes it easier for them to be plugged in via USB cable to your existing infrastructure, such as your WiFi access points or security cameras. What's more, Ariadne doesn't require an Ethernet connection, as it can stream data via your WiFi or make use of the cellular network. This means there's no need for considerable electrical cabling or heavy installation.",
    "text-19":"But that's not all! ",
    "text-20":"Each Ariadne surveyor can scan up to 1200m",
    "text-21":"while a single stereoscopic camera can only scan 20m",
    "text-37":"This means that for every Ariadne surveyor you install, you're saving the installation of 60 stereoscopic cameras. Imagine the time and effort you can save by installing Ariadne instead of traditional camera solutions!",
    "text-22":"Accurate Demographics",
    "text-23":"We understand the importance of accurate demographics, which is why we are able to tag the gender of a visitor from the entrance to the trajectory throughout the shopping mall. We assure you that the gender of a person will not change while in the mall. This information can be used to better understand your customers and tailor your marketing strategies.",
    "text-24":"Key Differences From Cameras",
    "text-25":"Ariadne's unique feature is that it can differentiates between employees and visitors, ensuring accurate data that is not skewed by employee movement. Our service provides detailed durations of stay for every area you select, as well as transitions between those areas. These are key performance indicators that traditional cameras simply cannot provide.",
    "text-26":"But that's not all! ",
    "text-27":"Our opt-in function also allows for bidirectional communication, giving you the ability to actively communicate with people in the mall or passively after they leave. ",
    "text-28":"This feature not only enhances the visitor experience, but it also provides you with detailed analysis for each visitor and the locations they visited individually.

    "text-31":"But that's not all - the benefits of our data extend far beyond just negotiating leasing prices. Our data can also be commercialized to your tenants, giving them insights into where their customers are coming from and where they go after visiting their store.
