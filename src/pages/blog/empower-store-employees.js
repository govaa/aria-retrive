                                            <p className="fs-5 blog-text">For decades, physical retailers have relied on intuition and traditional marketing methods to make decisions, but the rise of ecommerce has disrupted the industry. As consumers increasingly turn to online shopping, physical retailers are struggling to keep up. As a response, many traditional physical retailers have attempted without any success at opening online stores of their own. However, opening an ecommerce store is not necessarily the solution, as it requires expertise in various areas such as marketing, pricing, promotions, SEO, and platform selling.</p>

                                        </div>

                                    </div>

                                    <p className="fs-5 blog-text">Instead, physical retailers can leverage the power of their physical stores to compete with ecommerce. This is exemplified by global giants such as Apple, Amazon, Zalando, and Casper, all of which started as ecommerce businesses but thrived after opening physical stores.</p>

                                    <p className="fs-5 blog-text">One key advantage of physical stores is the ability to present a brand through human interaction. Sales representatives in physical stores can provide a personalized shopping experience and build a rapport with customers, something that is difficult to achieve online. Furthermore, physical stores can showcase products and create a tangible experience that cannot be replicated online.</p>

                                    <p className="fs-5 blog-text">Keep in mind that having loyal customers can provide significant benefits to a business. Loyal customers tend to spend more money and buy more frequently than new customers, resulting in increased revenue. Retaining customers is also more cost-effective than acquiring new ones, which reduces marketing costs. Additionally, loyal customers have a higher customer lifetime value (CLV), generating more revenue over their lifetime. They also advocate for the brand, increasing visibility and acquiring new customers through referrals. Lastly, loyal customers provide valuable feedback to help businesses improve their products and services and meet customer needs.</p>

                                        <p className="fs-5  blog-text">At Ariadne, we have observed that the most advanced scheduling mechanisms utilize sales data. In certain scenarios, users can set sales goals for the week, and the algorithm will generate a schedule that accounts for contractual employee availability. While this approach is sophisticated, it assumes that the conversion rate of visitors to customers is evenly distributed throughout the day. As a result, missed opportunities due to high demand, limited employee skills, or poor visitor experiences are not addressed in the scheduling process, ultimately leading to a decline in customer loyalty, which can impact the strength of the brand and overall revenue.</p>
